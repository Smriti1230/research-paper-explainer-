# research-paper-explainer
# 🧠 Research Paper to Blog-Style Explainer Generator
This project simplifies complex academic research papers—particularly from sources like arXiv or academic conferences—into easy-to-understand blog-style summaries. Using state-of-the-art AI and Natural Language Processing (NLP), the system extracts core components like problem statement, methodology, and key takeaways, and presents them in a way that non-experts can grasp.

## 📘 Project Topic
### "AI-Powered Academic Research Simplifier"

Input: PDF research papers from arXiv, conferences, or academic journals
Output: A blog-style summary that covers the research problem, approach/methodology, and key results, tailored for readers without a technical background.

## 🎯 Goal:
Bridge the gap between technical researchers and the public by making academic insights more accessible and digestible.

## 🧰 Libraries and Tools Used
PyPDF2 – Extracts clean text from academic PDF files.

InstructorEmbedding – Hugging Face model (hkunlp/instructor-xl) that generates context-aware embeddings with task-specific instructions.

faiss-cuda – Enables fast semantic similarity search among text chunks.

transformers – Accesses models like LLaMA for summarization.

meta-llama/llama-4-scout-17b-16e-instruct -A powerful open-source large language model from Meta, used here to generate conversational, easy-to-read summaries from complex academic text.

Streamlit –  Powers the interactive web app, allowing users to upload PDFs and instantly view blog-style summaries.

## 🧭 Project Workflow
Upload Research Paper – User uploads a PDF via the Streamlit interface.

Text Extraction – PyPDF2 retrieves clean textual content.

Text Chunking & Embedding – Text is split and encoded using InstructorEmbedding with instructions like "Represent the methodology from this paper".

Semantic Search – FAISS locates the most relevant chunks for each explainer section

Summarization – LLaMA 3 Instruct generates concise and readable explanations

Display Summary – The final output is shown within the Streamlit app in a blog-style format

## ✅ How to Use
Open the Colab notebook.

Upload any academic research paper in PDF format.

Let the system process and summarize key content.

## 📌 Input & Output Example
Sample PDF Input:
Title: "Transformer-based Models for Document Summarization"

Problem: Summarizing long documents is still challenging for NLP models.

Method: Introduces a hierarchical attention mechanism for long text.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on benchmark datasets.

Blog-Style Output:
🔹 Problem: Long documents are difficult for traditional models to summarize accurately.
🔹 Approach: This paper introduces a layered attention method to better handle complex content.
🔹 Key Takeaways: The proposed model outperforms previous methods on multiple summarization benchmarks.

## 🚀 Future Enhancements
Support for scanned or image-based papers using OCR.

Summaries in regional languages like Hindi or Bengali.

Option to download or share summaries as PDF or blog posts.

Integration with a Q&A chatbot for interactive learning.

## 📑 License
Developed for academic and learning purposes as part of SRMCEM’s Summer AI Bootcamp 2025. All methods and models are for educational demonstration only.
